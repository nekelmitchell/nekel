## Passions
I am deeply passionate about space exploration and the boundless possibilities it holds for humanity's future. 
I used to sing with my father ever since I was 3 then a year later I transitioned into dancing and became very passionate about it. In my teenage years I also grew a love for acting.
When I was younger I loved to draw and paint all the time. As an adult I haven't had as much time getting to create art, but I'm hoping to start again this summer.

## Projects
I am currently working on a astronomy/computer science research project where we theorize how well one could determine a comet orbit using a crappy cellphone camera and some celestial mechanical methods. We create a code to try and find the coment's orbit.
I am currently working on writing a paper about security awareness when it comes to LLMs.
I am currently trying to learn how to code games in order for me to create my own game and be able to launch it.
